Things that still need to be accomplished:

1) Campbell terminal still crashes when attempting to interface with raw serial out of Mote. Contact Campbell to see if this communication issue can be resolved.
2) Write application to log serial data and deliminate based off of stop bits in serial string.
3) Activate and interface with serial modem.
4) Set up TCP/IP or FTP communication with server.
